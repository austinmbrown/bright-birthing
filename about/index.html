<h2>About</h2>

	<p><img style="width:310px; float:right" src="/img/lily.JPG">
	After attending over 35 births I am more certain than ever that our bodies and hearts work wonders. A professional member of Birth Matters, VA since late 2012, I have been impressed by the Birth Circle meetings hosted at <a href="http://www.bendcville.com/" target="_blank">Bend Yoga</a>. Bend is also the homebase for monthly meetings of <a href="http://cvilledoulas.com/" target="_blank">C'Ville Doulas</a>, a great group of women. As an aspiring midwife I joined <a href="http://commonwealthmidwives.org/" target="_blank">Commonwealth Midwives Alliance</a> and was honored to attend my first gathering of that group last winter at <a href="http://www.birthingplace.com/" target="_blank">The Birth Centre of Charlottesville</a>.</p> 

	<p>In 2010 (in the months leading up to my wedding) I trained as a birth doula at <a href="http://www.naturalresources-sf.com/" target="_blank">Natural Resources</a> in San Francisco. Shortly after that I witnessed my first homebirth, and was welcomed into a wonderful circle of doulas called <a href="http://rebirthingcollective.org/" target="_blank">(Re)Birthing Collective</a>. The professional organization in the Bay Area, <a href="http://www.sfdoulagroup.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Doula Group</a>, provided a larger community of birth-workers and continued education during my years there. I served as a volunteer with the <a href="http://badp.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Bay Area Doula Project</a> as well - through that program I was certified to support a full-spectrum of pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth and abortion. In the Bay Area I attended births at five hospitals as well as homebirths.</p>

	<p>I believe that every person desiring the support of a doula should have one, regardless of their budget. Because of this, I offer my services on a sliding scale. It's crucial that I am able to keep a roof over my head and cover my expenses, but I am open to negotiating a fee that works for everyone. I have also been trained in shiatsu, prenatal yoga and am excited to offer birthing arts including henna, belly painting, labor altars and mandalas. Call or email today to find out whether we're a good fit!</p>
