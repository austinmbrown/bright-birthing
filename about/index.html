<h2>About</h2>

	<p><img style="width:310px; float:right" src="/img/lily.JPG">
	After attending over 40 births I am more certain than ever that our bodies and hearts work wonders. I am studying the art and science of midwifery but plan to continue supporting families as a doula throughout my training. My passions for visual art, narrative and interpersonal connection inform my work and relationships.</p> 

	<p>In 2010, in the months leading up to my wedding, I trained as a birth doula at <a href="http://www.naturalresources-sf.com/" target="_blank">Natural Resources</a> in San Francisco. Shortly after that I witnessed my first homebirth, and was welcomed into a wonderful circle of doulas called <a href="http://rebirthingcollective.org/" target="_blank">(Re)Birthing Collective</a>. The professional organization in the Bay Area, <a href="http://www.sfdoulagroup.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Doula Group</a>, provided a larger community of birth-workers and continuing-education during my years there. I served as a volunteer with the <a href="http://badp.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Bay Area Doula Project</a> as well - through that program I was certified to support a full-spectrum of pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth and abortion. In the Bay Area I attended births at five hospitals as well as homebirths.</p>

	<p>I believe that every person desiring the support of a doula should have one, regardless of their budget. Because of this, I offer my services on a sliding scale. It's crucial that I am able to keep a roof over my head and cover my expenses, but I am open to negotiating a fee that works for everyone. I have also been trained in shiatsu, prenatal yoga and am excited to offer birthing arts including henna, belly painting, labor altars and mandalas. Call or email today to find out whether we're a good fit!</p>
