<h2>About</h2>

	<p><img style="width:310px; float:right" src="/img/lily.JPG">
	After attending over 45 births I am more certain than ever that our bodies and hearts work wonders. I am studying the art and science of midwifery but plan to continue supporting families as a doula throughout my training. My passions for visual art, narrative and interpersonal connection inform my work and relationships.</p> 

	<p>In 2010, in the months leading up to my wedding, I trained as a birth doula at <a href="http://www.naturalresources-sf.com/" target="_blank">Natural Resources</a> in San Francisco. Shortly after that I witnessed my first homebirth, and was welcomed into a wonderful circle of doulas called <a href="http://rebirthingcollective.org/" target="_blank">(Re)Birthing Collective</a>. The professional organization in the Bay Area, <a href="http://www.sfdoulagroup.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Doula Group</a>, provided a larger community of birth-workers and continuing-education during my years there. I served as a volunteer with the <a href="http://badp.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Bay Area Doula Project</a> as well - through that program I was certified to support a full-spectrum of pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth and abortion. In the Bay Area I attended births at five hospitals as well as homebirths.</p>
	<p>We relocated to Charlottesville at the end of 2012 and the birthing community here is so rich. Currently I'm an associate editor for SQUAT Birth Journal which is published quarterly. Along with Birth Matters, I love connecting with the Month 10 Doulas' mamas' cafe at C'ville Cofee, the nascent volunteer doula program for refugee families, as well as my inspiring classmates at the Academy of Experiential Midwifery Education. I gladly work with families choosing in or out of hospital birth. </p>
