<h2>About</h2>

	<p><img id="lily" src="/img/lily.JPG">
	I am a professional member of Birth Matters, VA and have been impressed by the Birth Circle meetings they host at <a href="http://www.bendcville.com/" target="_blank">Bend Yoga</a>. Bend is also the homebase for monthly meetings of <a href="http://cvilledoulas.com/" target="_blank">C'Ville Doulas</a>, a great group of women. As an aspiring midwife I have also joined <a href="http://commonwealthmidwives.org/" target="_blank">Commonwealth Midwives Alliance</a> and was honored to attend my first gathering of that group this winter at <a href="http://www.birthingplace.com/" target="_blank">The Birthing Place</a>.</p> 

	<p>In 2010 I trained as a birth doula at <a href="http://www.naturalresources-sf.com/" target="_blank">Natural Resources</a> in San Francisco. Shortly after that I attended my first homebirth, and joined a wonderful group of doulas called <a href="http://rebirthingcollective.org/" target="_blank">(Re)Birthing Collective</a>. The professional organization in the Bay Area, <a href="http://www.sfdoulagroup.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Doula Group</a>, provided a larger community of birth-workers and continued education during my years there. It was an honor to serve as a volunteer with the <a href="http://badp.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Bay Area Doula Project</a> as well - through that program I was certified to support a full-spectrum of pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth and abortion. In the Bay Area I worked with nearly 30 families, attending births at five hospitals as well as homebirths.</p>

	<p>I believe that every person desiring the support of a doula should have one, regardless of their budget. Because of this, I offer my services on a sliding scale. It's crucial that I am able to keep a roof over my head and cover my expenses, but I am open to negotiating a fee that works for everyone. I have also been trained in shiatsu, prenatal yoga and am excited to offer birthing arts including henna, belly painting, labor altars and mandalas. Call or email today to find out whether we're a good fit!</p>
