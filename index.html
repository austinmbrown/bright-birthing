<p>I provide compassionate and skilled presence in support of peaceful, conscious childbirth. Every pregnancy deserves the support of resources and reassurance. Through childbirth preparation and guidance during your birthing, my goal is bringing calm and groundedness to the experience.</p> 

<p>As a student-midwife I am especially fascinated by homebirth, the midwifery model of care, yoga and deep relaxation. It is an honor every time I witness an empowered birthing mama.</p>

<p><strong>Call or email me to set up a consultation today.</strong></p>
