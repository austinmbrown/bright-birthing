					<p>Passionate about bringing calm and groundedness to the experience of birth, I am especially fascinated by homebirth, the midwifery model of care, yoga and deep relaxation. My vocation is to empower a birthing mama to create the ideal situation for meeting her baby - whatever her preferences might be. I provide compassionate and skilled presence in support of peaceful, conscious childbirth.</p>
