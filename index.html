					<p>As a student at the Academy of Experiential Midwifery Education, I look forward to continuing to provide doula support as I journey toward serving as a midwife. Passionate about bringing calm and groundedness to the experience of birth, I am especially fascinated by homebirth, the midwifery model of care, yoga and deep relaxation. I provide compassionate and skilled presence in support of peaceful, conscious childbirth and it is an honor each and every time I witness an empowered birthing mama welcoming her baby.</p>
