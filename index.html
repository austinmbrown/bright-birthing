    <h2>Charlottesville's doula agency: individualized care with the support of a village.</h2>
    <p>We provide compassionate and skilled presence in support of peaceful, conscious childbirth and parenting. Every pregnancy deserves the support of resources and reassurance. Through childbirth preparation, guidance during your birthing and support in the postpartum time, our goal is bringing calm and groundedness to your experience.</p>
    <blockquote>"The mothers come from near and far. They have a variety of birth plans and care providers. We are there to shower them with village attention and support and to bathe them in a sense of belonging and being cherished. The one inspiration and encouragement we echo over and over in our stories, on our walks, in our drumming and deliciously in our feasting is this: Trust your Instincts. Follow what makes sense to you. Do it your way. Take your time. Find a place of peace to make decisions. Speak your Truth. Find your Truth. Your body has all the right answers. No one has your knowing. Build your instincts. Trust your instincts," - Sister MorningStar</blockquote>
