<h3>Stephanie Post</h3>

<p>Stephanie attended her first birth at age three, the birth of her brother and can’t remember a time when she didn’t feel called to midwifery.</p>
<p>Stephanie graduated from nursing school in 2005 and has been a pediatric nurse for over 10 years. She has traveled the United States and the world, sometimes as a travel-nurse and sometimes for the pleasure of adventure. In 2010 Stephanie trained as a doula and has found great joy in supporting women and their families during the birthing time.</p>
<p>In 2014 Stephanie began her training as a student-midwife. The same year she experienced her own home-birth and was floored by the magic, incredible beauty and crazy intensity of it all. She is now more certain than ever that she is on the right path.</p>

<h3>Hannah Bukowski</h3>

<img class="headshot left small-6 medium-5 columns" src="/images/headshot-hannah.jpg">
<p>Hannah is a mother, student midwife, world traveller, and nature lover.  As an adventurous 20-something, she lived and worked all over the world in search of her life’s passion.  She tried on many hats including CEO of a restaurant collective, ESL teacher abroad, and nature connection mentor.  Hannah finally discovered her calling to birthwork and breastfeeding support through her own journey to motherhood.  While preparing to give birth at home and caring for her infant son, Hannah spent countless hours reading and researching about birth, breastfeeding, and parenting.  For the first time in her life, she actually enjoyed studying!</p>
<p>Hannah believes that birth is a rite of passage for women. Ultimately, her goal is to help return birth to women and families through education, awareness, and midwifery care.</p>
<p>When Hannah is not studying or chasing her sweet toddler, she is honored to provide doula services, breastfeeding support, and postpartum care to local families.</p>

<h3>Sara Zia</h3>

<img class="headshot right small-6 medium-5 columns" src="/images/headshot-sara.jpg">

<p>Sara moved to Charlottesville to pursue graduate studies in philosophy at UVA and has been working as a yoga instructor since completing her degree in 2009. Since high school, and until the recent birth of her own baby she worked intimately within families providing childcare. Sara’s path as a doula began when she attended a prenatal yoga training with a view to expanding her teaching repertoire. She arrived assuming she would merely be learning how to adapt postures to the pregnant body but walked away with much more, including her own birth plan and a bottomless respect for women and their capacity to grow and give birth to new human beings. Sara’s background in yoga, philosophy and caretaking shape her personality and approach as a doula.</p>


<p>Sara’s passion for working with women in the childbearing year grew as she continued to lead mamas in prenatal and postpartum yoga practice, putting her on a path to become a homebirth midwife. During her first year as a student midwife Sara experienced her own first pregnancy and became a mama when Sufi Grace was born. She would not change a thing about the way Sufi was born and is so proud of what she accomplished on that long, mystical morning. Sara wants to support women in birth such that they might look back on their experience with the same self-compassion, sense of empowerment and pride.</p>

<p>Each birth Sara has attended to date has been an unprecedented gift; she cannot imagine not being on this path. Sara believes that every pregnant woman is the site of a new miracle, that birth is a sacred gift and an opportunity for spiritual transcendence. Sara is grateful and honored to be present with a woman in all her beauty as she claims her power, and then, at that miraculous intersection where soul meets body in breath--when a new baby, a new woman and a new family is born.</p>
