		<p>Stephanie attended her first birth at age three, the birth of her brother and can’t remember a time when she didn’t feel called to midwifery.</p>
		<p>Stephanie graduated from nursing school in 2005 and has been a pediatric nurse for over 10 years. She has traveled the United States and the world, sometimes as a travel-nurse and sometimes for the pleasure of adventure. In 2010 Stephanie trained as a doula and has found great joy in supporting women and their families during the birthing time.</p>
		<p>In 2014 Stephanie began her training as a student-midwife. The same year she experienced her own home-birth and was floored by the magic, incredible beauty and crazy intensity of it all. She is now more certain than ever that she is on the right path.</p>

		<p>Hannah is a mother, student midwife, world traveller, and nature lover.  As an adventurous 20-something, she lived and worked all over the world in search of her life’s passion.  She tried on many hats including CEO of a restaurant collective, ESL teacher abroad, and nature connection mentor.  Hannah finally discovered her calling to birthwork and breastfeeding support through her own journey to motherhood.  While preparing to give birth at home and caring for her infant son, Hannah spent countless hours reading and researching about birth, breastfeeding, and parenting.  For the first time in her life, she actually enjoyed studying!</p>
