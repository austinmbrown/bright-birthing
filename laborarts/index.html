<h2>Labor Arts</h2>
<p>Visual and expressive arts can play a great role in supporting the inward journey of pregancy and labor. For a blessingway or baby shower a belly blessing with henna may be a delightful way of celebrating your changing body.</p>

<h3>Mandalas</h3>
<p>My painted mandalas are available framed for contemplative meditation or simply for decoration and can be custom-designed for color pallette and size.</p>

<h3>Altars</h3>
<p>Finally, I encourage my clients to choose treasured items or symbolic objects for creating a small, portable labor altar. This is a great way to bring the love and support from home with a laboring mom to her birth place, if it's elsewhere.</p>
