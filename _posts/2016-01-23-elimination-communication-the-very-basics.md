A few months ago, I became a Go Diaper Free Certified Elimination Communication Coach.  I discovered Elimination Communication (EC) as part of my own parenting journey and felt strongly that families in our community would be interested in an earth-friendly baby-connecty way to handle their children's elimination needs...you know, pees and poos.  Since becoming an EC coach, I have welcomed a sweet second boy into our family, so I've been taking my sweet time adjusting to our new family life.  I'm excited to give a short talk about EC at our January 31st  Village Circle gathering and very much looking forward to helping local families start EC-ing with their own sweet littles in the coming months.  For those who might be unfamiliar with EC or just learning, here's a little intro to EC and my personal EC philosophy.  



#### WHAT IS EC?

When my first son was born, I was super committed to using cloth diapers, because I perceived that as the most earth-considerate way to care for his elimination needs.  But I still wondered...what did people do before diapers?  So, I did some research and discovered what we now know as ELIMINATION COMMUNICATION.  The term pretty much sums it up, too!  EC is a way to communicate with babies about their elimination needs, by paying attention to the signals they use to show us they're ready to...pee or poo.  I love that the term is COMMUNICATION, not OBSERVATION.  This cues us in to the notion that babies are letting us know what's going on with their bodies and expecting us to assure them that we are getting the message!  What a great way to start life!

#### HOW DOES IT WORK?
Even as newborns, most babies signal when they are going to pee or poo.  Some babies' signals are easily perceived, and some are more subtle.  I can't help but believe that, just as adult humans, babies would prefer not to soil themselves and not to spend hours in soggy diapers.  It makes perfect sense to me that caregivers would be able to pick up on baby's signals after some intentional observation time. So, really, the first step of starting to EC is believing that baby anticipates your help with eliminating.  THEN, naked observation time helps gain an understanding of baby's signals.  Soon, cues can be added so that baby learns to associate a sound or action from the caregiver with the opportunity to eliminate.  

After learning baby's signals, it is up to caregivers to decide how they will help baby get the business done!  Over a towel, over a toilet or potty...the options are almost endless, and might be different depending on your situation and location.  

So, it can be pretty simple...

1. watch baby
2. learn signals and cue
3. help baby go  

There can also be complications, of course!  Sometimes it is difficult to perceive signals, or signals change over time.  Traveling, day care, siblings, and LIFE can seem to get in the way.  But, I believe your EC practice has to work for YOU.  So, there are lots of techniques for helping baby to potty even if signals seem vague.  And, as with many aspects of parenting, you can be as hard core or as relaxed about EC as YOU want.  

#### WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFO?
Come to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/173350209690368/" target="_blank">Village Circle gathering on January 31st</a>.  I'll be giving a brief talk on the basics of EC.  You can also check out my <a href="http://godiaperfree.com/hannah" target="_blank">Go Diaper Free website</a>.  As soon as I start feeling like I've got this mom-of-two-kids thing locked down, I'll be offering a monthly free EC support group, classes, and private consultations.  I'm so looking forward to it!
