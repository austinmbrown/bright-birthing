At Bright Birthing we celebrate and honor women throughout the female/feminine life cycle. It feels especially important to shower them with extra love and support during the sacred journey to motherhood. Whether it is her first child or she’s made this journey before, one beautiful way to shower a mom-to-be with love is through a Blessing Way ceremony.

By tradition, a Blessing Way is a Navaho ritual created to support and empower a new mother during her journey of birthing and motherhood. There are many ways to celebrate a new momma and the beauty of a Blessing Way is it can be molded to fit the needs of any woman. The most important thing is that the woman is being honored, loved, supported, and empowered within a sacred circle of her closest friends and family. This circle is usually all female but, if she desires, it is absolutely appropriate to include important males in the momma’s life such as her partner, father or brother.  

My parents hosted a Blessing Way for me to celebrate my transition into motherhood and bless the passage of my child into this world. It was such a very sweet time for me. Gwen created a beautiful henna mandala on my big baby belly and also decorated the other guests' hands and feet. At the end, we held hands and my mom led the group in some sweet songs of blessing. I felt so very loved and honored! I was thrilled that my daughter was coming into the world surrounded by so much love!

Shortly after the birth of my daughter I attended a Blessing Way for a good friend. We were invited to introduce ourselves by acknowledging the women of our heritage. “I am Stephanie Lauren Post, daughter of Jeanne Demory Post, granddaughter of Helen Demory and Shirley Post, mother of Demory Anne Post Bernard.” Speaking these words made me feel incredibly powerful and so very connected to all of the women who have come before me and will come after me. 

Because of these very powerful personal experiences, I strongly support and encourage women to consider such a ceremony. It is an honor to be able to offer this service to our Bright Birthing families. When planning a Blessing Way for the beloved momma-to-be we will sit down with the hostess/host and together plan the most perfect ceremony for her.
