*This is a guest post by Liz Henke of [Talking Drum Herbals](http://www.talkingdrumherbals.com/the-comfrey-chronicles).*<br><br>
Yesterday afternoon, I had the blessed opportunity of sharing space with a local doula group, Bright Birthing.  This wonderful group of women works to bring individualized birthing and postpartum care to the Charlottesville area.

On the last Sunday of every month they gather the women from the families they have and continued to serve, as well as other birth workers and holistic practitioners in the area to share community circle.  Being included in the loving, feminine centric energy every month has come to be one of my favorite ways to spend a Sunday afternoon.

When Gwen asked me to share a talk and meditation with the group this month, I was elated!  We chose the topic of altar creation, which is a subject I love to share on, and for the meditation, I went with the opening sounds of sacral and heart crystal singing bowls.  

I arrived a little early to get set up, and Gwen had the perfect spot for me to birth a big, elaborate altar.  This was ideal for holding space for the group. 

Women arrived and I began my talk with sharing what an altar is.  An altar is a place for holding space, it is a focal point for energy and intentions that you are working on and with.  They aren't religious in nature, they are beautiful and unique expressions of the person or group creating the space.

Altars can have a theme, such as fertility, or even working on a specific chakra.  Then again it may just be space that you need to hold for the energies inside yourself.  Either way your altar should be a creation born from that energy.  It is important to note that there is no one way (or wrong way) to bring an altar into being. 

There are some things to keep in mind when creating your sacred space though.  The size of the area is important, as well as, the need or function the altar will play.  For instance, if you have a nice spacious spot in which to permanently create your space then the items you use to honor that space will be vastly different, then say if you are in need of a small, portable style altar that you can take with you on vacation or even to a hospital birth to continue to hold space for your journey into parenthood.  

An altar is a place for deeper connection, as you or the group grows and evolves the altar should too.  You may come to a point where items seem to no longer hold the energy you need or maybe you come across things that you feel drawn to include. Altars should be a dynamic, fluid space.  One that grows, lives, and evolves as you do. 

To help inspire and illustrate the broad range of items that you can use to hold and honor sacred space, I am including a short list of things I have used in various altars I have created along my path.

* A journal- when I sit in my space, it often evokes feelings, memories, and ideas that I need to remember
* Statues of varying sizes
* Crystals, gemstones, shells or rocks (I've collected) with specific properties or special meaning for me
* A cloth- This can be anything from a decorate scarf, cloth napkin, a small handkerchief, to a blanket
* A sound maker- drum, rattle, song pod, etc...
* Smudge- herbs used to cleansing and call in space
* Herbs- special plants that hold space for my intention and also to use as an offering, or to give thanks 
* Affirmation cards- thoughts that I work with to increase my focus
* Candles
* Drawings, photos, or art that reflect my intention
* Perfumes, or sprays
* Feathers

*This is by no means a complete list, but is a good resource of ideas and inspirations.  

Many of the items that I have included on altars have been things that I myself have created somehow, and by doing so, this has increased my connection with those items because of the focus, love and intention that went into to them.  That being said, it doesn't matter if you are a master artist or can barely manage a stick figure, if you feel called to do so, I highly encourage having a hand in the creation of your items, or at least seek out pieces that you know have been birthed with the same love and intent that you would pour into them yourself.

This creatix energy was alive and well yesterday in the Bright Birthing circle, as we sat after my talk working with clay to create small statues; in the intention bundles we made with herbs and cloth; as well as in the mothering images we colored all with the love and purpose of adoring the altars gestating in our minds.  

I am so very grateful to Gwen, Hannah, Stephanie, and Sara for welcoming me with warm hearts into such a loving and nurturing group, and also for giving me the opportunity to share this passion subject with the circle. I look forward to many more times shared with them. 

If you are interested in learning more about altars, I will be teaching Creating Sacred Space again next month (August 2015) at the Twin Oaks Women's Gathering in Lousia, VA.   You can also check out our events calendar for information on any of the workshops we are offering.

Happy Creating & Green Blessings!
