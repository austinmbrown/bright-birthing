I get a little thrill each time someone walks into my home and remarks on how good it smells. There are bedtime pillow spritzes, anointing oils for our bodies, blends added to water which is vaporized by a candle burning below in the diffuser - all ways I incorporate aromatherapy into daily life.

Working with families in childbirth preparation, during labor and in the early days of parenthood, aromatherapy is one aspect of sensory comfort I always share. At one of our prenatal appointments I like to bring my collection of essential oils and blends and encourage parents to give them all a sniff. Ideally they will select a couple of scents they find calming and also a couple at the energizing end of the spectrum. 

Some folks have specific associations with aromas or memories triggered by a particular fragrance, but there are also traditions and conventions around certain oils that I’ve found to be consistent in practice. I usually don’t like to impose too much of my own experience with oils and rather explore the preferences of each individual, but regardless of your reasoning for choosing a scent, aromatherapy can lead to mindful breathing, which is always a good thing.
