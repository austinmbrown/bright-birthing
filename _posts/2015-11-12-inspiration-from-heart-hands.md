My babe is finally down for her morning nap and I’ve managed to sink into a corner of the couch with a cup of chamomile tea and my copy of “Heart & Hands: A Midwife’s Guide to Pregnancy and Birth,” by Elizabeth Davis. This book is not only an invaluable learning resource for midwifery education but can also be an excellent and comprehensive source of information relevant for child-bearing women, especially those interested in learning more about the difference between the medical versus midwifery model of care.  I thought I might share a few excerpts that resonated with me from the first chapter:

<img class="small-5 columns" src="/images/blog/heart_and_hands.jpg">

> “It is ironic that feminism has not more strongly aligned itself with midwifery, especially since reproductive self-determination is central to the feminist vision. Truly, what could be more feminist than the practice of midwifery? Giving birth calls on a woman to shed her social skin and discover her ability to cooperate with and surrender to elemental forces. Birth can profoundly transform a woman, strengthening her faith and deepening her identity. Hence the midwife, guardian and facilitator of this process, is intrinsically feminist by the very nature of her 
work. “

> “For the most part, women who choose midwifery seek connection, they long to rise above divisiveness and competition to establish support systems and create community.”

> “Giving birth is more than just having a baby; it is a pivotal event in a woman’s personal development. Midwives have traditionally cared for women throughout their lifecycle, facilitating the physiologic milestones of menarche, birth, menopause and death. These times of transition are more than just biological: they are our Blood Mysteries. In them, we gain wisdom through our bodies that utterly transcends any rational process. Many indigenous cultures have deliberately created rites of passage for men involving sacrifice and suffering (such as the Native American Sundance) to replicate the growth and transformation rendered naturally 
to women through their Blood Mysteries.”

> “When women are in charge of their environment, when they have the privacy to labor undisturbed, when they feel completely at ease and supported, outcomes are always superior.”
