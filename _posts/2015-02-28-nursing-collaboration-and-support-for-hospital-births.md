Families in Charlottesville choosing to welcome babies in our local hospitals have a pair of good options. In February both the University of Virginia Medical Center (UVA) and Martha Jefferson Hospital (MJH) welcomed local doulas for gatherings that fostered communication, cooperation and the collaborative care that will serve to support future births.

AT UVA, Charlottesville Doulas were asked back to share a workshop on comfort measures with labor and delivery nurses. Last year we offered the workshop twice, with a series of stations set up through which the nurses rotated. This time we worked with nursing students, new hires and a few folks who had been around the unit for a while, but were interested to pick up some new tools. In three adjacent labor and delivery rooms, pairs of doulas distributed handouts and research papers, practiced positions and massage techniques, explained the differences between methods of encouragement around pushing and my station included acupressure and aromatherapy. One nurse said she had never met a doula before that day and all around there was a really convivial mood. We all get into the work of supporting families in labor and birth because it is a peak experience and there is so much love of service in a group of nurses and doulas!

The following week Charlottesville Doulas were invited back to Martha Jefferson Hospital for a roundtable discussion on doula/nurse collaboration after a successful meeting on the same topic two years ago. Many of the same folks attended this time, but it was exciting to have several new faces among us as well. That meeting happened to fall on a Wednesday evening, just after my normal knitting group (Caring Embrace) which meets weekly near the piano in the Martha Jefferson lobby to knit and crochet shawls for patients. It was sweet to bid farewell to my knitting friends just as the doulas began to arrive. We were able to submit questions and discussion topics ahead of time and the conversation in a labor and delivery suite was casual, comfortable and informative.

The open dialogue between nurses and doulas at both UVA and MJH this month means that if we attend your birth in either hospital, chances are good weâ€™ll recognize some of the nursing staff. Research - and my experience - shows that the camaraderie and communication of the birth team can really make a difference; the tone of the environment plays a big role in your comfort and in the memories you take from your birth experience. Thanks to both hospitals for inviting us this month, and thanks to the doulas who chose to spend some time building the rapport that will certainly be of benefit to families in the future!
