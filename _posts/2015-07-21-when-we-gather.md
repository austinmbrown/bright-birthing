Last month I hosted our Village Circle in my home and I’m happy to say that in addition to the beautiful friends and mamas that join us from time to time, our group has established regular attendees. We aim to alternate every other meeting with a group project and a talk by a guest birth professional.

When we gather we do so with a spirit of inclusion and support, we listen and laugh, hold one another’s babies, share wisdom and insight, eat delicious snacks, listen to good music and always try to close on a relaxing and restorative note. We welcome you into our homes, into our hearts and into our village.  Please consider joining us some time, perhaps even this next Sunday afternoon. Write to us and let us know if you have any suggestions for how you’d like to see us focus our time together.

Truth is, as doulas we are privileged with the honor of sharing the most intimate and powerful of experiences with the families we serve. Our Village Circle provides an opportunity for us not only to foster new friendships and build community, but to continue to support our clients and nourish the connections we are so fortunate to make.  So please stop by some time and help us give shape to something beautiful!
