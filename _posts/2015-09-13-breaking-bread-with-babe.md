> "One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating." ~ Luciano Pavarotti and William Wright, Pavarotti, My Own Story

Wendy Vigdor-Hess (author of Sweetness without Sugar) was our August Village Circle guest speaker.  We had a great turnout including the trusty regulars as well as some new lovely mama and babe friends.  Wendy presented us with a thorough outline on the topic of introducing solids to baby and then opened the circle up for questions. This topic rang close to home for me since my baby girl, Sufi Grace, now 9 months old recently made this culinary transition.

I remember when Sufi showed her first signs of interest in my food, reaching for it and delighting in the unfamiliar sensation of tasting something different. She was merely 4 months old then, and I thought, way too young. Mostly, I felt threatened by the idea of sharing myself as the source of her nutrition. I was worried that it might compromise our beautiful breastfeeding bond. Suffice it to say—it didn’t. Wendy also thinks that 4 months might be too early, but not without exception. She explained that 6 months is an ideal time to start since babe’s digestive system is likely to be adequately developed by then to handle new foods.  However, Wendy also says that whenever babe starts consistently reaching and showing interest it might be a good time to be open to experimenting and seeing how babe’s digestive system responds.

And that’s exactly what ‘breaking bread’ with babe should be—experimentation and pleasurable family time at the table. Wendy pointed out that breastmilk or formula will be babe’s main source of nutrition so there’s no need to stress about making sure she gets a healthy dose of all the major food groups just yet. Rather, introducing solids provides an opportunity to experience new textures, flavors and ways of interacting with foodstuff and other family members at mealtime.

Simple ingredients are best. Wendy says that taking 5 - 7 days with each new ingredient is a good strategy since that gives babe time to get used to the new food but also enables us caretakers to test new foods so that we can trace potential allergic and upset belly reactions back to their cause. Sufi and I started out doing this but then it got complicated one night when my mom pureed my favorite Persian eggplant dish for her which includes a complex variety of ingredients. Sufi did fine with this food (after all, she was built on the dish in utero. For the record, I’m only kidding. There’s no evidence based reason for such a correlation) but had she experienced a reaction I would not have been able to determine whether, for instance, the culprit was the eggplant, turmeric, tomato or garlic. She did have a reaction to strawberries the first time, a mild skin rash that upon subsequent doses of small amounts did not re-emerge.

Here are a couple of other things that we learned from Wendy in the course of our discussion:

1. That it is okay to raise your baby on a vegetarian or vegan diet. This will not limit babe’s digestive capacities to such a diet if in the future she is inclined to include meat and dairy in her eating repertoire.
1. The nutritionist/allergist jury has mixed messages about peanuts but the latest seems to be that introducing peanuts before the first year might be a good way to prevent a peanut allergy from developing.  (I did joke about serving the first spoonful of peanut butter while parked outside the ER, just in case. I’m not convinced that this is an entirely unreasonable thing to do if peanut allergies run in the family.)

Here’s the truth: One of my all time pet peeves is hearing people chew their food (all food, but especially things like Cheetos over the phone or starburst candy in a movie theatre) but not Sufi. I delight in the sounds she makes, not just the gumming noises but also the mmming sing-song sounds of yumminess. I love watching her handle food to nourish herself.  It’s okay and necessary for mealtime to be absolutely messy. Wendy had a lot of great information to share and a lot of good answers to our questions. The takeaway point, the bit that fits in a nutshell is, to trust that you know your baby when the time is right, to invite the introduction of solids with a spirit of pleasure, conviviality, experimentation and exploration, as well as attentiveness. It’s a time to gather and explore new sensations and to delight in leading your babe to one of the greatest pleasures physiologically, sensually and socially in which we humans are blessed to partake.
