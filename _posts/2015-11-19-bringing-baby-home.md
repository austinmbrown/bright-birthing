description: It’s crazy how you can be totally overjoyed and in complete crisis at
  the same time...
---

Diapers: check. Bottles: check. At least two baby carriers: check. Strollers and blankets and car seats and innumerable other baby paraphernalia - all incredibly adorable: check, check, check! I’ve read books and attended classes. I’ve got my birth plan and my birth team and I’m as prepared for the birth as I can be. I’m even prepared for postpartum because I have good friends who tell me all the things “no one tells you.” Also, I’ve been a pediatric nurse for 10 years so I’m golden! Ha!

I was not, however, at all prepared for the changes my husband and I would experience in our relationship. Our precious baby joined our family and we were completely in love with her AND things were much harder than I had anticipated. Some of the hard things were not a huge surprise, breastfeeding and lack of sleep. In case you don’t have kids yet, let me tell you, lack of sleep is no joke. It’s a very real thing; I guess that’s why there are one million books about it. I honestly used to think these new parents were just being kind of wimpy. They’re not! New parents are the biggest bad-asses you’ll ever meet!! The greatest shocker to me was how much having this tiny human in our lives impacted my relationship with my husband. It’s crazy how you can be totally overjoyed and in complete crisis at the same time…in fact, I know of no other life experience that creates this combination of emotions. I know not all families share this experience but having the opportunity to work with many families during their birthing years and beyond has allowed me to see that this joyful, love-filled crisis is pretty global.

My daughter was 16 months old when my mom, Jeanne, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and marriage and family therapist, invited me to join her in attending Dr. John Gottman’s *Bringing Baby Home Instructor Training* course In Denver, Colorado. I imagine her intention was three fold; most importantly she got to spend time with me, she was supporting me in my passion for helping new families, and she secretly knew this would be very helpful for my own family. She’s got me figured out! In preparation for the course I read “And Baby Makes Three” by Dr. John Gottman and was immediately able to create improvements in my marriage - of course, mom was right! I was pleasantly surprised as I prided myself in thinking that my marriage was pretty good. After experiencing these improvements I was thrilled to be attending the conference. 

Dr. John Gottman is a world-renowned therapist and researcher who specializes in marital stability. He and his team have conducted extensive research on families with new babies and as it turns out, I was right to think this was a pretty universal experience. Their research showed that “within three years after the birth of a child, approximately two-thirds of couples will experience a significant drop in their relationship quality and will have a dramatic increase in conflict and hostility”.  Two-thirds?! That’s huge right?! I’m happy to trust my intuition (which told me this new parenting thing is harder than it looks) but, man, does my medical/nursing side LOOOVE some good research and the Gottman Institute has got it! 

The best part is not only do they have research on the difficulties we experience as new parents but also on effective ways to work through them and create healthier, happier families. In the course we learned how to maintain relationship satisfaction after having a baby, reduce relationship hostility and increase affection (super important in my own relationship!), promote positive parent-baby interactions, promote quality involvement for both parents, and reduce the incidence or severity of postpartum mood disorders. Yay!!

The course was interactive and fun. I learned amazing new skills and got to meet wonderful people from around the world. I also got to spend a long weekend with my mom and explore some of the Denver area with her. The best part, however, is that I am now able to bring this information back to those bad-ass new parents in my own community. I am so happy to have more tools to share and more ways to support the families of Charlottesville. I look forward to teaching the Bringing Baby Home workshop in Charlottesville in the near future.
