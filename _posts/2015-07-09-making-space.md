Sometimes in a circle of people sharing an intention to support one another I find myself speaking my mind and heart in a way I might be unable to foresee or plan. This summer I’ve been participating in a group called Women Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, and I had such a moment at our most recent gathering.

Over the past several months and increasingly in recent days I’ve found openings in my schedule, obligations relieved, feelings of stagnation have given way and I’ve noted resentment dissolving. This is purposeful to some extent, but even in instances that involve less agency there’s a pattern I’m noticing and appreciating. The space that’s opening in my calendar and in my heart is making way for what I want to gestate and bring to fruition. 

I am creating conditions for fertility and it’s a blessing to realize it while the process is underway. May the rest of the summer be a time of continued conscious conception for me and for you. Let’s clear the way for what’s to come and open the necessary space for what we’re cultivating. Let’s continue meeting in circles with one another, listening and speaking, encouraging and comforting. This is rich soil we are building.
