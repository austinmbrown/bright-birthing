Nearly four years ago I made this post on the blog of my former doula group, (Re)Birthing Collective in San Francisco. Over my career as a doula and first 50 births, some things have evolved and my serenity with pregnancy and birth is certainly more authentic now. Some things have not changed, though, which is heartening! Working first in California and now in Virginia, I still believe that building a team is one of the best ways to serve one another in birth, parenting and life in general. Trust is of the utmost value, and I am thrilled to work with Stephanie Post and Hannah Bukowski as a team in addition to the care providers chosen by the families we serve. Enjoy this throw-back post from 2011:

> I believe in team-building. Cooperation and community investment make great things happen, even in temporary teams like those that form around a birth. Setting up an us-versus-them mentality benefits nobody in a birth setting, least of all the birthing mom and baby who deserve to be surrounded by peace and love. As part of my doula training I was given an article titled something to the effect, “Can doulas and nurses exist in the same room?” This sentiment occurs to me occasionally in a hospital setting, and always reminds me of how silly I first found it. Of course we can exist in the same room!

> A wise doula pointed out to me that when you go to the hospital, it is because they have something you need. This is true whether you’re transferring from an intended homebirth situation, or whether you’ve planned a hospital birth all along. “When is the right time to head in?” I’m often asked. To some extent we play it by ear and pay very close attention to both mom and her partner for clues. Has her communication between surges changed dramatically? Have the surges accelerated significantly? Is mom flushed and taking off layers? Is she experiencing sensations in a totally different part of her body, maybe feeling rectal pressure?

> During a homebirth transfer last summer I was so impressed when a midwife introduced the hospital anesthesiologist to all of us by his first name. They were old friends, and this relationship immediately brought ease and comfort to the room. The epidural was precisely what that mom needed in that moment, and after a few hours of much needed rest, she was fortified to continue her epic and beautiful labor. Both her midwife and the anesthesiologist were warm, intelligent, cordial and talented individuals who served that mom well, but the relationship of trust between them was really the secret ingredient to a positive experience.

> Whether you’re planning to give birth at home or in one of the excellent hospitals in the Bay Area, it seems to me that the most important choices come down to being surrounded by the right people. Will a parent, sibling or family member distract some moms during labor? Of course in some cases that’s true, but my most recent two births have included glowing grandmothers who were more than welcome and in the second instance served as a second doula through some of the labor. Friends, doulas, partners and sometimes children can create just the energy a birthing mom desires. There are certainly moms who prefer to keep things as simple as possible and some even desire complete solitude, but I have been thoroughly impressed and honored to be part of some exceptional birthing teams recently.

In celebration of the [Bright Birthing Team](/aboutus), please join us for an Open House Reception on Sunday January 25 from 4-6pm. We have a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/337696536417516/) page set up and will be distributing flyers around town.
