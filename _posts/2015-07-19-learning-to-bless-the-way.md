On a rainy June afternoon, Lisa Olko welcomed the Bright Birthing team into her home to share her experiences and insights on Blessingway Ceremonies.  All of us at Bright Birthing had shared excitement about offering Blessingway as a service to our clients and community, so we were thrilled at the chance to learn from someone with decades of experience.  I was especially interested, since I was early in my pregnancy and looking forward to a Blessingway to celebrate the coming of my second child.

It felt like an honor to be invited into Lisa’s home and welcomed with open arms.  Our time together was spent in a room that seemed to be designed to evoke the goddess in all women-a warm space filled with images, icons, books, and art.  It is a very special space, even womb like, the perfect place to learn the ceremony of Blessingway and how the tradition can be used to mark the transition from womanhood into motherhood.  

As the rain poured outside, we sang songs and talked through the many possible elements of a Blessingway ceremony-the smudging, singing, reading aloud, and showering the mother-to-be with love, adoration, and respect.  I must admit, I even got a little teary-eyed imagining myself surrounded by beautiful friends, opening myself to the changes ahead, welcoming the transition to mothering two children, and receiving the love of my community.  As our conversation deepened, Lisa shared aspects of the ceremony that highlight the notion that the woman coming into the ceremony space is not the same as the mother who emerges.  By styling the new mother’s hair, adorning her head with a floral wreath, wrapping her in a unique robe or dress, and washing her feet, even her outward appearance is changed through the course of the ceremony.  Perhaps a birth altar is prepared or trinkets are shared to later remind the mother of all those who love and support her during the birth time.  Of course, the ceremony can be changed to suit the mother’s wishes, but the focus remains the same-a celebration of and preparation for change!

In a few weeks, my friends will gather in my home for my Blessingway.  I feel exceedingly grateful.  These women have seen me and my family grow and change.  They have seen me laugh and cry.  Many of them only know me as a wife and mother.  It is so special to feel that I am part of a community that will embrace me and my family as we become a new family of four, no longer three.  I feel so vulnerable when I think of myself sitting there as a friend places a wreath on my head or washes my feet.  It is comforting to know that these are the same friends who will check in on us after the baby comes, and that I will carry that love back to them as their own families grow and change.  

At Bright Birthing, we feel so honored to witness some of the most special and vulnerable moments in our clients’ lives.  It is truly our hope to offer a lasting sense of community and connectedness to the women and families that we serve.  We are so happy to offer Blessingway Ceremonies to clients and community members.  It is our pleasure to tailor the ceremony to signify the coming of motherhood and other life changes that deserve the recognition and support of a village.  

Our monthly village gatherings provide a fantastic opportunity to connect with women and mothers in the Charlottesville area.
