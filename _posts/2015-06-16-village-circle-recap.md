Debbie Wong is a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) serving the women of Charlottesville. I was so blessed to have her as my midwife. Each prenatal appointment would start the way any prenatal appointment starts; pee in a cup, check my blood pressure and heart rate and listen to the baby’s heart tones. Debbie would spend invaluable time educating my husband and me on pregnancy and birth and answering our many questions. And then FINALLY would come the time for which I had been waiting. I’d get to lie back on the table and have my belly rubbed! I recognized at the time that the abdominal massage she was performing was much more than just a “belly rub” but as a pregnant momma it didn’t seem to matter what it was called or what it’s purpose was. I just knew it felt AMAZING!!

Having had such a positive experience with Debbie as my midwife and with her abdominal massage technique, I was thrilled when Debbie agreed to join us for our May Village Circle to discuss Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy (ATMAT). 

Debbie started by discussing her own personal experience with ATMAT and how she’s seen the positive effects in her clients throughout the birthing year. She shared stories of women who were struggling with fertility whom she was able to provide care for prior to conception, throughout their pregnancies and go on to attend their births. We also learned that ATMAT is helpful for digestive, urinary and reproductive organs for those who are not pregnant. I was pretty excited when I learned that she offered her ATMAT service independent of prenatal care!

During my pregnancy Debbie referred to ATMAT commenting, “at the very least, it allows me to connect to the momma and baby.” While I believe that is reason enough in itself, it is clear to me that Debbie’s practice of ATMAT is so much more than that.

While Debbie talked, we all worked on some very sweet mothering and birthing coloring sheets that included affirmations. I chose one that affirmed that I am a good mother - it’s nice to have that reminder! Debbie closed her talk with a beautiful guided meditation that helped us to connect with our uteri. We were so fortunate to share this time with Debbie. It was a lovely Village Circle!
