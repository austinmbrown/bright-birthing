In retrospect there were several assumptions inherent in my first doula training. We focused on the physiologic study of pregnancy and birth and learned many ways that doulas could support someone through those transformative processes. Although unspoken, the assumptions were that the pregnancy was wanted and resulted in a live birth - these are not the realities for every pregnancy.

A couple of years later several doulas, student-midwives and reproductive justice workers in San Francisco came together to found the Bay Area Doula Project, modeled on New Yorkâ€™s Doula Project. The group that coalesced for the inaugural training learned from seasoned abortion doulas, grief counselors and others how we could serve folks through all manner of pregnancy outcome. 

It is my heartfelt belief that every pregnancy deserves the compassionate, nonjudgmental support that doulas are trained to provide. We strive to honor and validate your values, process and choices. Open-hearted listening, physical presence and comfort measures can be of benefit to folks during and following any pregnancy and it is in that spirit I was trained to work as a full-spectrum doula.

Charlottesville folks so inclined are welcome to join us for our September Village Circle. It will be a quiet time to reflect and hold space for all pregnancy loss. Near the autumnal equinox, recognizing the balance of darkness and light: a thoughtful, contemplative time to gather and remember miscarriage, stillbirth and abortion. Our gathering will include poetry, prose, prayers and anything you hope to share. Contributions are welcome including candles and symbolic objects.
