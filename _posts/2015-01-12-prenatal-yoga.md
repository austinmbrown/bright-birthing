I have a very clear memory of waddling across the downtown mall, moving as quickly as I could get my big baby belly to move, because I just couldn’t stand to miss prenatal yoga! As I approached the glass doors of the studio I could see that I was already too late. The doors were closed and locked.

I knew all the good students who had arrived on time were already in the yoga room smiling, laughing and sharing their experiences; supporting one another,  doing all the things I loved so much about prenatal yoga… without me!  I thought about sneaking away and saving myself the embarrassment but I did not choose that option. No, this was worth the embarrassment! Instead, I started jumping around and waving my arms and doing everything I could think of to get the instructor’s attention, hoping that she might forgive my tardiness and let me join in. And eventually she did, because she is kind and loving and truly embraces mommas and all of our quirks. I soon found myself enveloped in the warmth and peace that is prenatal yoga, surrounded by fellow mommas, who had also waddled themselves to this safe place where we could all relax into pregnancy. Not to mention work all those mommy muscles that would prove to be so vital in the coming months!

Last weekend, a year since the “jumping around outside of the yoga studio” experience, I completed my prenatal yoga teacher training with Leslie Lytle. It was fabulous! I am so excited to have the opportunity to facilitate the sense of community that comes along with a prenatal yoga class. I very much look forward to helping mommas to look within, to rediscover their own strength and innate wisdom. I also hope to bring some of the wonderful benefits of prenatal yoga practice to my doula clients. I will treasure the day a momma rushes in late, frazzled and stressed and I am gifted the opportunity to help her to feel safe, calmed, loved and supported.  

Last week I was lucky enough to take Leslie Lytle’s prenatal yoga teacher training and loved every minute of it!
