What a lovely final Village Circle for 2015 we had! As the pace of life seems to speed up during the holidays and our need for rest and introspection grows in the final month of the year, we have decided to forego a December gathering and we will pick up again in January. Between now and resuming our monthly events, there are some great ways for you to stay in touch with the doulas of Bright Birthing.

**Lending Library:** at my apartment right on the Downtown Mall is a sweet collection of books, magazines and other resources that are available for you to borrow. Just drop us a note to plan a visit and feel free to ask questions about whether we have books on your lists for birth preparation, breastfeeding, parenting, etc. We also have free samples of iron supplement Floradix, lactation tea, nipple cream and more. 

**Consultations:** we are excited to offer hourly sessions in prenatal and postpartum support; prenatal, couple and parent-baby yoga; abdominal massage; elimination communication; local birthing options; blessingway coordination and more. Reach out if there are any services or areas of expertise of interest to you that may not be listed here already - we are excited to share our knowledge and experience in this way!

In the new year there will be new additions to the innermost circle of the Bright Birthing village! In the springtime Sara and Hannah will be on-call for births while Steph and I both take some time off-call to welcome new babes into our families. We are so grateful for the midwives, teachers, herbalists, clients and friends that have blossomed around us this year into a cherished community.
