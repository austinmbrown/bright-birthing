It’s 4 am on Christmas day and I can’t sleep. What better time to write Sufi’s birth story? After all, she was born on December 7th last year and though that is early in the month of December, I still consider her a Christmas baby.

Sufi began her descent on the morning of a full moon. On the morning of December 6th I woke up around 6 am to a little puddle beneath me, a dampness that I was sure indicated that my waters had broken. During the late stages of my pregnancy, my husband, Tal, was accustomed to sneaking off to the couch in the middle of the night and leaving me to toss and turn in the bed on my own. When I realized what had happened and with much excitement, I came down the stairs and told him. I urged him to get back to sleep and crawled back into bed to do the same. By 8am the sun was up and so was I. The excitement was too great to stay in bed so I headed to Whole Foods to buy snacks for my birth team and flowers for my birth altar with which to greet our Sufi. 

As I strolled through the market, fluid slowly soaking the pad I wore, I began to feel waves of period crampy sensations much like the mothers who gave birth before me described early contractions would feel like. These mild sensations began a stirring in my heart that I can only describe as a gradual opening up. I strolled the market putting fruits, nuts, chocolate and flowers in my cart with a big smile thinking *‘What my fellow shoppers do not know is that my Sufi is on her way.’* I had such a happy secret! The second person to learn my waters had broken was the man who was scooping up my fresh gnocchi behind the counter. The excitement overtook me and I said to him, *‘Guess what? My waters are broke. My baby is soon on her way!’* He congratulated me warmly and handed over what would be the first meal my birth team would eat after Sufi would arrive.

I wanted to pace myself. I did not want the excitement to exhaust me or to be under some illusion or expectation that just because my waters had broken she would come to me quickly. I decided to alternate rest to store my energy with activity to get things moving.  My plan was to drop off my groceries, then go for a walk by the river. By 10am I was back from the market and I had texted my birth team with the first update. I called Kate White and asked her if she would meet me at my home around noon to give me a prenatal massage in my bedroom after my walk, and she agreed. 

When I got to Riverview park, the cramps continued every ten minutes or so. It was a cloudy gray morning and it was sprinkling. As the cramps continued my heart continued to slowly open to heaven. I looked up at the sky, and that image of the sky would return to me during the hardest parts of labor. I had a vision of my soul travelling to heaven to bring her down to earth. Sufi was in the sky and I by the river with my feet on the ground, my heart opening and my spirit rising to meet her. 

Weeks before, when I was putting together the music for my birth, among the songs I selected for my ‘deep mood’ soundtrack was ‘Knocking on Heaven’s Door’. When I reviewed my playlist I superstitiously wanted to be sure not to have any morbid tracks (since the veil between life and death is so thin). I decided that I would keep this song on my playlist because I imagined that Sufi was in heaven and that my work was to get there, to knock on the door and bring her down. Later, in an illuminating healing session with Cecily Armstrong I had a vision of my late grandmother, who had birthed 10 babies of her own a lifetime ago, holding Sufi behind that door, ready to hand her to me whenever I made my way up.

And so I walked by the river, my heart opening and the sky following me above, its image etched in my mind. I texted my sister and my best friend to let them know that I was on my way to get her, that she would be ready for me soon. This was the start of my spiritual journey. The tears streamed down my face, the flow of my tears echoing the flow of the river beside me. Still the contractions were gentle and mild. In fact, they were utterly beautiful sensations.

Not long after I made it back home Kate White was there to meet me. She prepared her table as I set my ‘deep moods’ birth tunes on to play and then I snuggled into my pillows on my side on her table. Half way through the massage Sarita Bennett, my midwife, arrived to set up her trays and check on me. She sat beside me as Kate relaxed me from head to toe, the music playing, my heart opening and the tears gently and steadily streaming down my face as I shared thoughts and feelings with them, while what magic and bliss was washing over me. During the hour long massage we counted about 10 contractions and before Sarita left she guessed it would not be long before I would be calling for her return. I, however, was still prepared for it to take days and planned to continue alternating rest with activity. I figured that after the massage I’d listen to the ‘dance’ or ‘Love Tal’ soundtrack and dance around the house, and then maybe a nap, before some yoga, and then a swim in warm water at ACAC…

So much for my plan! After the massage I put on my pretty silk red robe and walked around the house. Tal prepared the birth tub in our kitchen and I continued to pace my way through contractions that were still mild but getting stronger. By 2:30 I was on the couch, talking to Tal between contractions and stopping to breathe and cry through them when they came. The tears were not of pain rather, they were the outward expression of the intense opening I was feeling at my very core. Between contractions my heart was ever opening and an ecstatic energy buzzed through my body, leaving me all smiles and laughter, full of love. As the contractions grew stronger, they began to pull me into labor land and I would no longer talk through them. When Tal measured them 60 seconds long and only 4 minutes apart he insisted we call Kate Adamson (our good friend and the woman who was the officiate for our wedding) and Gwen Roberts (my dear friend and Sarita’s assistant for my birth) so that they might prepare to join us. Between contractions I thought, *‘They can come but I don’t need them’*. During contractions I thought, *‘Maybe it’s a good time for them to arrive!’* And it was not long before they did.

I continued laboring in ecstacy in my red robe, on my red couch, on all fours, hugging a pillow on the corner of the couch when the contractions rose, and then still laughing and smiling in my moments of rest. My heart still opening and the tears still streaming, I remember saying to Tal and Kate and Gwen that *‘Birth is amazing, this feels good’*. By 4:30 the contractions were more halting and started moving from period crampy sensations to a different kind of sensation altogether, one that is indescribable unless you have been in its grip. I remember asking that the clocks be turned around. I no longer wanted to be in time. I was entering a new phase in my journey.  I was turning a corner and it was not long before Sarita had arrived. The tub was in the kitchen but the contractions were becoming quite consuming and out of concern that I might not be able to get up the stairs to where I intended to deliver the baby, we decided to nix the tub and move to the bedroom where eventually I would end up delivering Sufi. The time must have been close to 5 or 6pm.

This is where things got very intense. The contractions would rise and consume me entirely. I was no longer chatty during my moments of rest, not like I was before. I recall saying *‘this is not fun anymore. I don’t like this any more!’* My birthsong was loud and distinctive and I let myself sing for the length of almost every contraction, reminding myself to keep my voice low and my mouth open. From some deep primal place, my voice inhabited a depth in my being that I’ve never before accessed or knew that I possessed, there was a haunting chant, a rhythm that swelled with the ebb and tide of each contraction. (I had imagined myself as being quiet when I would labor but in fact, my voice was not the same for days afterward from all the use and it’s a wonder I had not woken any neighbors when the windows were open).  When the contraction would cease I would say things like *‘Savasana!’* out loud to myself, and I would guide my body to relax-- my shoulders, my hands, my legs, my face. I would say, *‘Take my break’*. I would say things repeatedly, over and over again like, *‘this is what we’re doing, this is really happening’*. My mind took a turn at this point down a dark path. Shit got real. I was in very active labor, maybe transition, who knows? There was no time.  

I was spiraling. My heart had been opening at a slow pace like an aperture, letting in heaven’s light, but now it was stuck. I was desperate and afraid that I might not be able to carry on. I could not get comfortable whatever position I tried and I began begging my grandmother to show her the way.  I began begging Sufi to find her way down. I would chant *‘I can’t!’* and *‘ooouuut!’* gesticulating the down and out motion beside my swollen belly  during the contractions. I would say *‘I’m too exhausted! I don’t have much more in me’*. I was begging Sarita to tell me how many more contractions there would be because I thought that if I just knew how many, then I could get through it, only then could I carry on. Not knowing how much longer was driving me mad. All Sarita would answer in reply was *‘As many as it takes’*. I was no longer climbing my way up to knock on heaven’s door, instead, I wanted the door to open and for her to drop down. I wanted help! Unfortunately, birthing does not work that way. There is no help. It is something only one can do on her own. In this way we birth alone, just as eventually, when the time comes, we die alone. Ushering in the first and last breath are not under our control. I remember thinking to myself, *‘What if we went to the hospital and I got just a little bit of something to take the edge off? Something to knock me out and get her out? Why did I need to do this natural home birth thing anyway?’* I remember Sarita reminding me of what I was working toward, conjuring up images of Sufi’s sweet little rosebud mouth, and reminding me that I was going to meet my baby soon. I also remember thinking, *‘Cancel the order! Why did I need a baby any way?! What Was I thinking? Everything was fine before. This is too crazy, too hard!’* It felt impossible. Midnight was drawing close by now and it felt as if I had been laboring forever.

Finally something helped me to get back on track. I was laboring on the birth stool and Sarita said, *‘Let your bottom drop’*. Kate grabbed a rock from the birth altar that my friend Rebecca George had brought for me at my blessing way and she placed placed it in my hand. The rock had written on it simply the word *‘this’*. I held the rock and found a mantra, *‘let your bottom drop, just get through this one’*. I replaced the dark thoughts with this mantra and on some level of consciousness I had made up my mind that going to the hospital for drugs was not an option. I had decided to continue, that I could do this one contraction at a time, how ever many.  This is when I turned another corner and I was back on track. My heart was opening again, though it no longer felt ecstatic. It just was. It all just was and I had begun to surrender. During contractions I would rise up into a deep goddess squat and raise my arms, I would let my bottom, my whole lower body, drop, and as my birthsong sprang from deep and low in my belly I recited my mantra and held on to it in my mind.  This hard laboring continued, until I grew more and more tired. 

Surrender is not like a light switch. It’s a gradual release. And when I finally surrendered, it must have been close to 2am, I was ready to truly rest between contractions. My birth team had helped me, letting me pull on them, hang off of them and pace with them. Tal took me in and out of the shower repeatedly, whenever I’d ask. They supported me as I worked. I remember Gwen’s eyes and Sarita’s head on my knee. I remember Sarita rubbing my back. Every touch was just right.  But finally, I was tired and so on all fours I rested on Tal’s legs draped over the edge of the bed. While I slept, he’d lay back and rest. Sarita and Kate were lying on the floor resting to my left. Gwen sat beside me on the right, cross-legged with her spine tall and her eyes shut. My breath would change as a contraction rose and they too would all rise to hold space for me as I worked through it, then it would pass, and we’d all return to rest. This continued until at some point, let’s call it when the fetal ejection reflex kicked in, I got a rush of adrenaline. I looked around at my resting birth team and got bossy. I asked for a pear and nearly swallowed a slice whole. I organized everyone. It was time to have a baby! I asked Tal to lean against the headboard of our bed with a pillow in front of his chest upon which for me to lean back against. I asked Gwen and Kate to hold my legs back and for Sarita to guide me where to push with her finger. Gwen asked if I wanted music and it was the most beautiful touch that the song Tal and I got married to, a classical Sufi piece of music called ‘Journey To Eternity’ began to play off of the ‘meditative soundtrack’. I was not thinking of this song when I asked for that soundtrack but there it was playing. I asked that the song be put on repeat and so the same music that played when Tal and I walked down the aisle on the night we celebrated our soul’s connection was the music that played as I pushed. When I saw Sufi’s head crowning I was suddenly very excited again to be having a baby. I pushed hard and I rested with shallow breaths between. It did not feel like any long length of time before her head emerged, and her body followed and there she was--Sufi Grace Brewer-- on my chest with her big brown eyes blinking up at us, Tal being right there behind me with my mother’s-eye view. Sufi emerged at 3:30am on December 7th.

I can’t tell you how many days during my pregnancy I imagined what my first words to Sufi might be.  I always imagined they’d be something sweet like *‘O my god’* and *‘I love you. You’re perfect!’* Though labor was intense I never said a word of profanity and I was full of pleases and thank yous, but when Sufi was for the very first time in my arms and before my eyes, the first words out of my mouth were, *‘Where the fuck did you come from?! Look at you: You’re a fucking human being?! WOW! Oh my god! I love you!!! O how I love you. You’re my little buddy. We are going to go everywhere together!’*  (I recall these words well because unbeknownst to me Kate had audio recorded this moment, as well as some birthsong tracks from earlier during contractions. She also took many beautiful pics that I am forever grateful to have.) 

There is no room for self-consciousness in labor; these things are not planned. In a very real sense, there is not much room for a plan in labor either. It just is and one moves with it. And yes, one can try to fight it but that fight is pointless and stalling. I had a very spiritual birth experience, but don’t get me wrong. It was not all flowers and a walk by the river. I went somewhere dark. It was not pleasurable ecstacy and pretty the whole time. When I turned that corner, when I let it bring me down to my knees and I finally let go, that’s when I touched God. That was when I came back to myself. A new self. When I came back, there I was, never more present. There we all were, until it was time for Sufi to arrive. And she did. 

I do not subscribe to any religion, but I am spiritual and I am a mystic. I believe I experience God in every thing beautiful that surrounds us, in music and good poetry and prose, in the flowers, in the snow, in a set of friendly eyes, the sea and the sky. But not every ordinary experience opens me up to the light and love of the spirit that lives in us with the same extent of clarity and intensity. My birth experience is one of a handful of mystical experiences that has completely colored my soul and transformed my way of being. Every one in my birth team was an essential part of the story. Kate helped me to find my mantra and Gwen brought the music to which Sufi was meant to be born, and they did so much more than this simply with their faith and presence. My midwife was the perfect choice for me and it is an honor now to work with her and to learn from her how to help women find the power that she held the space for me to find. She began this work with me prenatally, in her own subtle way, the way a good midwife does. She did this by simply letting me do the work on my own and believing in me and in the process, especially when I faltered.  My husband saw a power in me that night that I had never before instantiated, and for lack of better words, our love rose to yet an even higher place. Sufi is the light of our life and I hope that I might find my way to raise her as soulfully as I worked to bring her here. 

Merry Christmas, friends. Thanks for reading.
