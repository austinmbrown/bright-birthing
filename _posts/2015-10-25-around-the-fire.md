As the temperatures drop and the leaves change color, it’s a great time to gather and lean on one another. For nearly a year we have been holding monthly village circles and we have hit a kind of stride that will sustain us through the winter and into a new year of sitting together, sharing stories, nourishing ourselves and taking wisdom back to our respective families.

Whether it’s meeting with new clients, spending time in playgroups with toddlers, attending births, bringing meals to one another or marveling at the passage of the seasons, we love this project of restoring a semblance of village to life here in Charlottesville. Today’s gathering, Birth + Beer, the Partner’s Perspective was open to all families and it was wonderful to have couples as well as three generations of one family spending time together around a firepit at Champion Brewery. We may not wait an entire year to repeat this one!
