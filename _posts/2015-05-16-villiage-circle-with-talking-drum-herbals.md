From our first conversation over tea at [Twisted Branch Tea Bazaar](http://www.teabazaar.com/) I was glad for myself and our community that Liz was here. Liz Henke is a community herbalist, serving through her company [Talking Drum Herbals](http://www.talkingdrumherbals.com/). We were introduced by mutual friends at the [Elderberry](http://www.elderberryherbals.com/) and within a few weeks Liz created a beautiful presentation for one of our monthly Bright Birthing Village Circle gatherings.

Not only did Liz speak knowledgeably and eloquently, but she set up a beautiful altar and brought samples of all manner of herbal preparations that support women’s health. We focused primarily on fertility and the postpartum time, but questions and tangents led us into many other realms of women’s and family medicine. 

The group enjoyed a pot of “fertili-tea,” with some of the mint and vanilla infused honeys Liz brought to share, and we wrote messages on prayer flags that will adorn ceremonial spaces Talking Drum Herbals hosts at festivals and other gatherings. Liz explained the benefits of vaginal steaming and described some of the herbal blends she creates inspired by goddess figures and all that they honor. One woman had a chance to try a steam and remarked that she felt very aware of her uterus at one point. For more information on steaming, be sure to visit [this page at the Talking Drum web site](http://www.talkingdrumherbals.com/goddess-steams.html). We also explored infused oils, teas, and prepared our own individualized calming spritzes from hydrosols, essential oils and flower essences.

We look forward to many future collaborations with Liz!
