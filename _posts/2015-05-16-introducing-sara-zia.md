*After the first birth we attended together, I had the distinct feeling that Sara and I had a bright future working together. It was an honor to be with her as she and her husband welcomed their daughter last winter, and I am so pleased to introduce her to the Bright Birthing community as the newest member of our team. In her own words:*

Sara moved to Charlottesville to pursue graduate studies in philosophy at UVA and has been working as a yoga instructor ever since completing her degree in 2009. Since high school, throughout her career as a student and until the recent birth of her own baby she worked intimately within families providing childcare. Several years ago Sara attended prenatal yoga training and felt a calling to support families in the childbearing year. She showed up to that training assuming she would simply be learning how to modify yoga postures for the pregnant body, but walked away with so much more—including her own birth plan and a bottomless respect for women and their capacity to grow and give birth to new human beings.

As a prenatal yoga teacher, Sara guides pregnant women through conscious movements and into moments of stillness and mindful relaxation that help to maintain strength, alleviate the common aches of pregnancy, as well as create space for mamas to connect with their babes and to their own bodies.  She believes that yoga can do a lot to prepare a woman physically and mentally for the work that awaits her on her birthing day.  Sara’s background in yoga, philosophy and caretaking shape her personality and approach as a doula.

Sara’s interest in pregnancy, birth and postpartum recovery grew as she continued to teach prenatal and postpartum yoga, leading her to enroll in an experience based midwifery school. During her first year as a student midwife Sara experienced her own first pregnancy and became a mama when Sufi Grace was born, December 7th, 2014. She would not change a thing about the way Sufi was born and is so proud of what she accomplished on that long, mystical morning. Sara wants to support women in birth such that they might look back on their experience with the same self-compassion, sense of empowerment and pride.

Each birth Sara has attended to date has been an unprecedented gift and one that has added more love and best memories to her life. She cannot imagine not being on this path. Sara believes that every pregnant woman is the site of a new miracle, that birth is a sacred gift and an opportunity for spiritual transcendence. Sara is grateful and honored to be present with a woman in all her beauty as she claims her power, and then, at that miraculous intersection where soul meets body in breath--when a new baby, a new woman and a new family is born.
