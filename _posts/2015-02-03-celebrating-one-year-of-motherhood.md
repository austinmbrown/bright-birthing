It has been one year since the birth of my precious daughter, Demory Anne. It has been a year filled with joy, frustration, exhaustion, awe, laughter, tears and most of all so much overwhelming love. I have delighted in watching her learn and grow and explore the world around her. 

I love her perfect spiral belly button and her tan birthmarks on her tummy and butt. I adore her hound eyes that look just like her daddy’s and the wrinkles in her thighs. I kiss her hundreds of times a day on any part of her body that I can reach. I love the smell of her breath. I am super offended and yet totally melt every time she replies “Na!” when I tell her “no.” She is fiery and feisty and brave and so very sweet. This love I feel for my little one is CRAZY!!!! I also never dreamed that motherhood would be so demanding or so very hard. I have had nights when I threw myself on our bed, positive that I couldn’t do it for one more day. And then I did. Because that’s what you do as a mom. In the beginning I remember thinking that the birth was easy compared to the rest of motherhood. I realize now that, in a way, the difficulty of labor and birth prepared me for the work that lay ahead. There have been many times in the last year when I have tapped into the power I felt during Demory’s birth and I know that strength is still a part of me. I remember the time my husband walked up and down the stairs with me as I labored and am reminded of what a perfect team we can be. I can hear my parents’ voices blending with mine and know that I am never alone. The birth of my child shaped how I show up in the world. In celebration of Demory’s first birthday I am sharing our birth story one more time. So here it is, this time with some photos! 

#### The Power of “Om”, Love, and Lunges

I am a nurse, a doula and a student of midwifery. I consistently attended prenatal yoga starting at six weeks. I took a birth preparation class TWICE, once as a student and once as a pregnant momma. I was about as educated and prepared for labor and birth as any person could be prior to having their first baby. Yet when my water broke at 11pm on February 22 I found myself standing in a surprisingly huge puddle of amniotic fluid laughing, shaking with adrenalin and looking expectantly into my husband’s eyes saying “what do we do?” He very calmly replied, “Call the midwife”. To which I replied, “no, what do we DO?”. 

Well he hugged me, giggled with me a bit, helped me calm down a little and again suggested I call the midwife. I think he was relieved to see sanity come back into my face as I did what he suggested. At that point my contractions hadn’t started yet and our midwife, Debbie Wong, encouraged us to all get some sleep, as we would have a lot of work ahead of us. I knew she was right but I was so worked up with adrenaline and excitement that I couldn’t relax enough. My mom came downstairs and kept me company while we watched The Mindy Project, something silly and completely ridiculous that made us laugh and helped me relax.

Before I go any further, I want to talk about the people who were present for our birth. My birth team consisted of my husband, my mom and dad, my doula, my midwife and her assistant. My team was exceptional!! I cannot imagine any one of them not being there. Our birth class instructor gave some very good advice, saying, “Don’t invite anyone to your birth who you wouldn’t feel comfortable pooping in front of”. Well I don’t want to poop in front of anyone, ESPECIALLY not my HUSBAND!!! Gross!!! In the end I did in fact end up pooping in front of all of them and I couldn’t have cared any less! Lucky for me I also pushed a baby out so no one really noticed. 

OK, back to the birth. So, around 1am, thanks to some ridiculous TV, I was calm and relaxed so mom and I decided to try to get some sleep.  I was able to sleep off and on, waking up about every 5-10 min with contractions until about 4am. I finally couldn’t stand to lie down anymore and was on my knees whimpering a bit when my husband, Aaron, woke up and asked how I was doing. I think I said something like “not very good” so he got up and we went downstairs. He immediately started pressing on my hips with each contraction, which helped a lot to relieve the discomfort I was feeling in my back. I’m so thankful that we took the birth class and that he had paid attention!! I had of course heard of “back labor” but had no idea just how intense it could be or that I would be experiencing it for the next 12 hours!! In fact, I’m gonna go ahead and say that ALL of labor and birth was significantly more intense than I had imagined and I’ve been present for many births!! 

My sweet Aaron also proved that he was listening when he started setting up our entire downstairs as our “birth room” exactly as I wanted it. In between contractions (which were consistently 3-5 min apart at this point) he bustled around the house lighting candles, turning on music, and turning out lights. I remember being a little surprised that he thought to do those things because I had completely forgotten that I even wanted them in the first place! 

When I had envisioned our labor I pictured Aaron and I slow dancing and looking deep into each other’s eyes. That was NOT what happened!! I couldn’t imagine being in any position other than hands and knees, or draped over the back of the couch, or standing with my weight on my hands against something. At one point I tried hugging Aaron for a contraction and I felt like I would crush him! Like I said, way more intense than I had imagined!

Around 6am my parents joined us downstairs. My mom immediately placed her hand gently on my back and a wave of relief ran through me. She also started “oming” at the same pitch as my labor groans. Now I have to say when I was preparing for birth I never dreamed I’d be so vocal. It was amazing how these guttural, animalistic sounds were coming out of me but they felt so good!! It kept me focused and also really helped with pain control. If I allowed myself to cry or my voice to get high pitched I felt out of control and the pain was worse. “Oming” was not something we had planned; in fact, if anyone had suggested it to me before I was in labor I think I would have been really uncomfortable with the idea. But when I heard the vibration of my mom’s “om” join in with my labor sounds I felt lifted up and really supported. I felt like I wasn’t doing it alone. I think after they joined us I only had one contraction when one of them wasn’t touching me and I felt panicky without the comforting hand and flow of their energy.

My dad was also amazing. I think he kind of acted as backup for whatever position needed it. Sometimes he’d take over squeezing my hips, giving my incredibly strong husband’s poor biceps a break, and sometimes he’d be the one with a hand on my back “oming”. Really he provided energy and grounding. I remember one point during transition when I was lying on the couch. I felt so deep within myself yet very present with a heightened awareness. I knew my dad was in the room but I couldn’t figure out where and I really needed to know! I think by knowing his location I felt grounded. He also went through the house opening windows and doors. I’m not sure how he knew to do it or if it was just a nice day but in many cultures they do exactly that to promote an easy birth. While preparing for the birth my dad kept joking that he’d just be the one to boil the water. We all giggled when he actually WAS the one boiling water to add to my birth pool. 

My midwife, Debbie Wong, arrived around 8am and I felt relieved to know she was there. She listened to the baby’s heart rate, got a set of vitals on me, suggested a new way to provide that much needed counter pressure and said “it sounds like you’re having a baby soon”. Those were some beautiful words!! She then seemed to fade into the background using her well-trained ear for signs of my labor progress, resurfacing occasionally to check that baby was doing well.

My timing might be a little off at this point but I think Dominique Clothiaux-Sarff, doula, friend and fellow student-of-midwifery, arrived around 9am followed by Norma, the midwife’s assistant. They both arrived with such peaceful energy and I was really happy to have our birth team complete! The team busied themselves with setting up their supplies and the birth pool and when they announced that the pool was ready I was super excited! The warm water was such a relief and I imagine it provided a much-needed break from all that hip squeezing they were doing! I loved being in the pool. Aaron was leaning over the edge of the pool with his arms draped around me. In between contractions they would put a cool towel on my forehead or wipe the sweat from my face and I’d fall asleep briefly in Aaron’s arms. At one point, wanting to keep my energy up someone offered me a bite of apple. I happily took it and chewed it but maybe 15 minutes later when they offered me a second bite I realized I had never swallowed the first bite! I think I just was too distracted. After that they stuck to sips of water and spoonfuls of honey to help keep my energy up. 

Maybe it was around noon when I was feeling so tired I just wanted to sleep. I was lying on the couch, my mom at my head, Aaron on my hips, Dominique massaging my legs and my dad at my feet…was he practicing reiki?! How does he know this stuff?!... I wasn’t making those deep moans anymore, I’m pretty sure I was just crying with every contraction. I was so grateful though that no one suggested I do anything else. At that point I just really needed to experience the pain. There was no other option. I just cried, felt the pain, and probably said “ouch ouch ouch” a lot. I had so many clear thoughts though. My thoughts went something like this; “too bad for this little girl that she’ll be an only child because I’m definitely not doing this again. If I do do this again I will DEFINITELY be getting an epidural. Oh! I totally understand now why people get pain meds!” And then in the middle of a contraction I grunted and my whole body pushed. I was so surprised that I think I even apologized for pushing. Well, with that sound the whole team was suddenly around me and excited and I had officially entered the pushing stage of labor. 

Debbie checked my cervix for the first time during my labor and confirmed that I was indeed fully dilated and ready to push my sweet baby out into this world. She encouraged me to feel her head with my hand and I did! I had a rush of love and excitement for everyone in the room. It was amazing to me that I suddenly was now very interactive. My medically trained self recognized these feelings as the flood of hormones that a laboring momma gets but my birthing momma side of me just enjoyed the overwhelming love I was feeling!! 

Well everything was set up and we were all ready to have a baby!! But my baby girl wasn’t quite ready to be had. About an hour into pushing Debbie asked if she could check me again and reported that I hadn’t made any progress. She suggested I get out of the pool, try to pee and change my position to encourage baby girl to get in a better position for birth. I sat on the potty for what felt like forever not peeing at all but really enjoying the breeze coming in through the open window until Aaron came and shut it because he didn’t want me to scare the neighbors with all my groaning. That was the only time throughout my entire labor that I felt annoyed with anyone! I really wanted that window open! So I couldn’t pee probably because baby was pressing on my urethra and lucky for me Debbie was able to do a quick in and out catheter and I felt so relieved to have an empty bladder!! They tried a few midwife’s tricks to reposition my sweet babe and then had me walk the stairs and do a ton of lunges. Thank goodness for all those squats and lunges we did in prenatal yoga because it actually felt really good to be moving and I felt really strong!! Aaron and I walked the stairs and lunged for maybe 30 minutes having pushing contractions at the top and bottom of the stairs. I have to add a side note here. I had learned about the “urge to push” but that does not even come close to describing the crazy pushing that happened to my body. I had no control over whether or not I was pushing. It wasn’t like “oh, yes, I do think I feel an urge to push”. I could add my own additional pushing effort but I certainly could not stop the strong pushing that my body was doing anyway. My midwifery teacher calls it “throwing down” sorta like the opposite of “throwing up” and that maybe describes it a little better. 

So it was maybe about four hours into pushing when Debbie informed me that we needed to do something else. I thought “oh no, here it comes, we’re gonna have to transfer to the hospital” but I was super surprised and relieved when she instead suggested we call the chiropractor!! And I thought, “I love these ladies!!”  While we waited for the chiropractor to arrive they suggested that (and by suggest I mean told me I had to) do an inversion. You heard me right, INVERSION, with my knees on the bed, my elbows on the ground, my butt up in the air, and my huge baby belly hanging somewhere in the middle and that they wanted me to stay in that position for THREE contractions, during which time I was having those crazy, uncontrollable pushing contractions. It was the first time throughout my entire labor that I thought I might not be able to do it. But at that point I was really out of options so I climbed up on the bed in hands and knees while they positioned Aaron in front of me for support. All of a sudden (though really it was after a lot of hard work and four hours of pushing) I could feel my sweet baby girl’s head shift positions and come further down the birth canal. I told Debbie and she confirmed that yes, in fact, my baby was finally ready to be born!! I remember her voice so clearly calling to Norma who was downstairs (along with all of the necessary birthing supplies) to “bring the birth kit”. “And my parents!!!” I added. 

I loved the pushing part when I could actually feel my baby making progress down the birth canal. It definitely hurt but it was by no means the hardest part of my labor. It was incredibly satisfying to be making progress and know that the hardest thing I’ve ever done was about to be over and that I would also have the greatest reward. I was very aware of exactly where the pressure was and I knew the exact location and moment when I got a very small tear. The birth team encouraged me to take it slow and give my perineum time to slowly stretch. I think I tried to slow down a little but at that point I knew we were close and I was ready to be done! 

My mom whispered in my ear reminding me that my body was made to do this. And she was right!! Because right there, surrounded by people I love, in our own room, on our own bed, with my hands on my precious husband’s knees I pushed out our beautiful, healthy, LOUD baby girl, Demory Anne. “Reach down and pick up your baby” Debbie told me and she ended up having to tell me twice because I was so so elated to be DONE!!!! I was proud and happy and strong. I felt like a MOM and like super woman!! I couldn’t believe what I had just accomplished!! 

Finally I did reach down and pick up our beautiful, screaming baby girl and brought her to my tummy hugging her close. I haven’t mentioned it yet but we have three big dogs. Throughout the entire labor they lay nearby, calm and quiet and occasionally gently checking on me. At the moment of Demory’s birth all three of them went from calm to excited and playful. We could hear them wrestling and running around all over the downstairs celebrating! Oh, and the chiropractor did make it just in time to add her peaceful energy to the room and witness Demory’s birth. 

While our sweet little family of three snuggled in bed and got to know each other the birth team busied themselves cleaning up and my mom cooked up a delicious pork chop dinner with all fresh Sweet Peeps Farm ingredients. Demory slept nearby and Aaron, my parents, and I had a picnic in our bedroom already reminiscing on our beautiful, intense, amazing birth.

One last side note; remember all those thoughts I was having about Demory being an only child? Well about a week after her birth I started thinking maybe I could do it again. About a month after her birth I found myself looking forward to experiencing another birth. And now four months out I seriously can’t wait to do it again and my poor husband has me negotiating for many more!! The incredible feeling of power I experienced and those wonderful mommy hormones must be addictive!!
